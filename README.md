# 🧪 Exploratory Data Analysis on Global Tuberculosis Data

This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on global Tuberculosis (TB) statistics using data from the World Health Organization (WHO). The analysis aims to uncover trends, correlations, and key insights into TB prevalence, incidence, mortality, and detection rates across countries and regions.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes the following key columns (per 100,000 population):

- `Estimated prevalence of TB (all forms)`
- `Estimated incidence (all forms)`
- `Estimated mortality (excluding HIV)`
- `Case detection rate, percent`

> 📌 Source: [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int)

## 🧪 Jupyter Notebook EDA
- Summary stats & null checks
- Correlation analysis
- Box plots, heatmaps, and scatter plots

## 🌐 Dash Interactive Web App
- Filters by year and WHO region
- Live visualizations (bar, scatter, choropleth maps, etc.)
- Global summary cards
- Export options (CSV, Excel, PDF)
- Mobile-friendly layout


## 🔍 Key Questions Explored

- Which countries have the highest TB burden?
- Is there a correlation between TB incidence and mortality?
- How does case detection rate vary across regions?
- Are there any outliers or unexpected trends?

## 📈 Visualizations

- Scatter plots (Prevalence vs Mortality)
- Heatmaps (Correlation matrix)
- Bar charts (Top countries by TB metrics)
- Box plots (Regional distribution)
